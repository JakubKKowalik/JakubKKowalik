Since a young age I am passionate about video production, from amateur stop motion animations through video game machinimas. Currently my videos cover both the latest and historical operating systems and software. My video showcasing the history of the Microsoft Windows operating system (https://youtu.be/DkAIdoSxWoU, English subtitles available) garnered over a million views on YouTube.

Besides video and audio editing, I am also skilled in graphic design (many years of experience with Adobe Photoshop) and web development (I know how to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, while also knowing the basics of PHP, SQL and currently learning JavaScript).

My interests in Internet media, TV and radio led me to study media management at Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland. I am an admirer of such formats as the American late-night talk-show, the British comedy panel show or the international gameshows; of their production, direction, set and sound design.

My personal interests include: cycling, playing the guitar, Formula 1.
